Bionic Blue ([website](https://bionicblue.indiesmiths.com) | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicblue)) is an action platformer game featuring a bionic boy tasked with protecting humanity against dangerous robots. It is a desktop game completely free of charge and dedicated to the public domain, in active development, created by Kennedy Guerra ([website](https://kennedyrichard.com) | [GitHub profile](https://github.com/KennedyRichard)).

This project and the game are part of the [Indie Smiths](https://github.com/IndieSmiths) project.

This project uses [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) to manage and generate the website.


## About the website

This website is meant to work as a story bible for the Bionic Blue game. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_(screenwriting)):

> A bible, also known as a show bible or pitch bible, is a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a television, film or video game project.

However, I don't like the terms "story bible", "show bible" or "pitch bible".

"Story bible" is bad because stories usually have a beginning and an end, but I want the document to be a reference for the universe where the game happens, potentially being used for sequels/prequels, not just a single story. There could even be unrelated stories spun from this documentation of the game's universe, so the term "story" would be a limiting factor.

"Show bible" doesn't cut it either because it is obviously not for a show, but a game. However, I also don't want the content to be constrained by the fact that it is primarily for a game. Think of it as being more general than that, eventually being adapted for the game, but not constrained by it, as this could serve as source material for other works, related or not, like other game titles, books, etc.

"Pitch bible" would also be limiting, because although this kind of work is great for pitching projects (and I do intend to include such kind of content in it), this material is also not just for pitching.

That's why I use the term "lore" or "lore website", which is much more general and open-ended.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to suggest and contribute changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please, if submitting a pull request, use the `develop` branch, not the `main` branch. This way it is easier to refine/complement your changes before merging them with `main`.

If the proposed change is small enough, you can submit your pull request (PR) for analysis right away to the `develop` branch and it will be answered ASAP.

If in doubt, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicbluelore/discussions) first, in order to discuss what you would like to change.

Since this project uses [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) to manage and generate the website, I recommend checking their website for instructions on how it works and how to use, so it is easier for you to contribute changes. In practice though, contributing changes usually boils down to creating and/or editing markdown files.


## Issues

Issues are reserved for things that break the lore/plot holes. Please, if you're not certain, [start a discussion](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicbluelore/discussions) instead. It can always be converted into an issue later if needed.
