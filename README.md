Bionic Blue ([website](https://bionicblue.indiesmiths.com) | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicblue)) is an action platformer game featuring a bionic boy tasked with protecting humanity against dangerous robots. It is a desktop game completely free of charge and dedicated to the public domain, in active development, created by Kennedy Guerra ([website](https://kennedyrichard.com) | [GitHub profile](https://github.com/KennedyRichard)).

This project and the game are part of the [Indie Smiths](https://github.com/IndieSmiths) project.

This project uses [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) to manage and generate the website.

Many different storylines and smaller stories play out in this world. Here's an excerpt of the main storyline's summary:

> On Earth, in the year 2500, advances in technology created robots capable of simulating the functions of the human mind. However, this state of simulated awareness, on top of consuming inordinate amounts of energy, causes the robots to hallucinate over time, as their fast robotic brains keep generating and processing information recursively.
>
> This turned them into a menace to humans in different ways:
>
> - some robots succumbed to madness, becoming hostile to humans.
> - other robots resorted to kidnapping humans, keeping them as hostages so the robots can scan their minds from time to time in order to use the data to alleviate their hallucinations.
> - both robot categories are hoarding energy and energy sources, including biomass, which deprives humans from them and generates conflict even amongst the robots.
> - some kidnapped humans don't believe humans can overturn their situation anymore, are content with life under the care of the robots and some of these humans even work for the robots in various positions, including management roles, defense and even help with the kidnappings.
>
> The free people, now severely reduced in numbers, struggle all they can to survive the clash with mad robots, avoid being imprisoned by the kidnapper robots and their human vassals, and try to secure energy and energy sources for their basic needs, like shelter, food and medical care.
>
> Blue is a bionic boy that helps protect people from such robots. He's one of the few humans who joined the fight for survival and decent living.


## About the website

This website is meant to work as a story bible for the universe wherein the Bionic Blue game takes place.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_%28screenwriting%29):

> A bible, also known as a show bible or pitch bible, is a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a television, film or video game project.

However, for the purposes of this documentation, I don't want to use the terms "story bible", "show bible" or "pitch bible". Each of them ties the contents to a specific medium or purpose (story, show, pitch). Sure, this kind of document is great for all of those purposes, but herein I want to use it mainly for the purpose of fleshing out the world. All other purposes, although important, are secondary to this.

I'd like this fleshed out world documented here to be entertaining on its own. I then want to use it as the base for many different kinds of projects/media.

That's why I use the term "lore" or "lore website", which is much more general and open-ended.

Of course, since at first it is being used primarily to help me come up with the world building for the game, it will be heavily influenced by that kind of medium, but even so I want this lore to be independent, to stand on its own as a complete document not tied to anything else. Instead, think of the game as being tied to it, to the rich world, characters and stories it describes.


## Support the projects

Please, support the Bionic Blue game and other useful software of the Indie Smiths project by becoming our patron on [patreon][]. You can also make recurrent donations using [github sponsors][], [liberapay][] or [Ko-fi][].

Both [github sponsors][] and [Ko-fi][] also accept one-time donations.

Any amount is welcome and helps. Check the project's [donation page][] for all donation methods available.


## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to suggest and contribute changes. Check the [how-to page](docs/how-to.md) to learn what's needed to contribute and other guidelines (some of them were pasted here as sections in this README document).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please, if submitting a pull request, use the `develop` branch, not the `main` branch. This way it is easier to refine/complement your changes before merging them with `main`.

If the proposed change is small enough, you can submit your pull request (PR) for analysis right away to the `develop` branch and it will be answered ASAP.

If in doubt, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicbluelore/discussions) first, in order to discuss what you would like to change.

Since this project uses [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) to manage and generate the website, I recommend checking their website for instructions on how it works and how to use, so it is easier for you to contribute changes. In practice though, contributing changes usually boils down to creating and/or editing markdown files.


## Using and uploading images

Images (characters, maps, graphs, sketches, etc.) can help your stories pop up or help show the world. Just like in a book, try not to abuse them, though. Of course, if you absolutely must use an image for some purpose, don't hesitate either.

However, please, don't upload them directly to this website's repository right away. Your story may change from your initial draft, resulting in changes in the visual elements depicted in your images, like characters, maps, etc.

So, instead, use a free hosting service like [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) and link directly to that image. Once your story is consolidated over time, you can ask the people managing the project to host your image in some more permanent way, either on our own servers or using another solution. Either way, there will be no cost for you (but again, try not abusing the usage of images, as hosting many heavy files can get expensive for the project).


## Discussing things

You can always start a discussion on the [discussion tab](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicbluelore/discussions) of the project for many different purposes. Here are some great ones (but, really, there's no need to limit yourself to these; as long as it is relevant to the project, your discussion is welcome):

- to give feedback about a storyline or record/account
- if you think some existing storyline or record/account or portion thereof doesn't fit the world, to suggest improvements or even in extreme cases and with proper explanation, suggest its removal
- share mediums that you created based on this world and its stories (remember, the project is public domain)
  - art
  - games
  - minigames
  - writing
  - even other versions/forks of this project approaching the world with your own unique perspective
  - etc.


## Issues

Only create issues for broken things or missing content within the website, like broken links, images that are not loading or that are missing, etc. Use the [issues tab](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicbluelore/issues) of the project for that.
