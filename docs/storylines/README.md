# Storylines

Here you'll find the storylines that unfold in the world.

Each storyline is like a book and is represented by a folder inside this one. Inside that storyline folder, there must be a central page (a README/index page) containing both a summary of the plot and a table of contents linking each chapter. Each chapter is a document within that storyline folder.

For instance, the main storyline can be found in the folder called **bionic-blue**. Here's its [README/index](bionic-blue/README.md) page.
