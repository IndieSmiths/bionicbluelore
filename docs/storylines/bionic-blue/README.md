# Bionic Blue

## Summary

On Earth, in the year 2500, advances in technology created robots capable of simulating the functions of the human mind. However, this state of simulated awareness, on top of consuming inordinate amounts of energy, causes the robots to hallucinate over time, as their fast robotic brains keep generating and processing information recursively.

This turned them into a menace to humans in different ways:

- some robots succumbed to madness, becoming hostile to humans.
- other robots resorted to kidnapping humans, keeping them as hostages so the robots can scan their minds from time to time in order to use the data to alleviate their hallucinations.
- both robot categories are hoarding energy and energy sources, including biomass, which deprives humans from them and generates conflict even amongst the robots.
- some kidnapped humans don't believe humans can overturn their situation anymore, are content with life under the care of the robots and some of these humans even work for the robots in various positions, including management roles, defense and even help with the kidnappings.

The free people, now severely reduced in numbers, struggle all they can to survive the clash with mad robots, avoid being imprisoned by the kidnapper robots and their human vassals, and try to secure energy and energy sources for their basic needs, like shelter, food and medical care.

Blue is a bionic boy that helps protect people from such robots. He's one of the few humans who joined the fight for survival and decent living.

The 02 categories of robots (assassins and kidnappers) are not organized into their own monolithic groups either. Some robots act in groups, some act on their own. Naturally, some of these groups stand out from others, growing into formidable organizations.

The only thing left for humans to do was arm themselves as much as they could, but as athletic as a human can become, that human can never surpass the unlimitedly upgradable body of a robot, nor can the human mind act with the same speed or processing power that a robotic mind has.

Because of that, many humans enhanced themselves with bionic parts in order to stand a chance, even if only to be able to barely defend themselves and their loved ones.
