> On Earth, in the year 2500, advances in technology created robots capable of simulating the functions of the human mind. However, this state of simulated awareness, on top of consuming inordinate amounts of energy, causes the robots to hallucinate over time, as their fast robotic brains keep generating and processing information recursively.
>
> This turned them into a menace to humans in different ways:
>
> - some robots succumbed to madness, becoming hostile to humans.
> - other robots resorted to kidnapping humans, keeping them as hostages so the robots can scan their minds from time to time in order to use the data to alleviate their hallucinations.
> - both robot categories are hoarding energy and energy sources, including biomass, which deprives humans from them and generates conflict even amongst the robots.
> - some kidnapped humans don't believe humans can overturn their situation anymore, are content with life under the care of the robots and some of these humans even work for the robots in various positions, including management roles, defense and even help with the kidnappings.
>
> The free people, now severely reduced in numbers, struggle all they can to survive the clash with mad robots, avoid being imprisoned by the kidnapper robots and their human vassals, and try to secure energy and energy sources for their basic needs, like shelter, food and medical care.
>
> Blue is a bionic boy that helps protect people from such robots. He's one of the few humans who joined the fight for survival and decent living.
