# Definition and purpose(s) of the Bionic Blue lore website

This website is meant to work as a story bible for the universe wherein the Bionic Blue game ([game's website](https://bionicblue.indiesmiths.com) | [game's GitHub repo](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/bionicblue)) by [Kennedy Guerra](https://kennedyrichard.com) takes place.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_(screenwriting)):

> A bible, also known as a show bible or pitch bible, is a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a television, film or video game project.

However, for the purposes of this documentation, I don't want to use the terms "story bible", "show bible" or "pitch bible". Each of them ties the contents to a specific medium or purpose (story, show, pitch). Sure, this kind of document is great for all of those purposes, but herein I want to use it mainly for the purpose of fleshing out the world. All other purposes, although important, are secondary to this.

I'd like this fleshed out world documented here to be entertaining on its own. I then want to use it as the base for many different kinds of projects/media.

That's why I use the term "lore" or "lore website", which is much more general and open-ended.

Of course, since at first it is being used primarily to help me come up with the world building for the game, it will be heavily influenced by that kind of medium, but even so I want this lore to be independent, to stand on its own as a complete document not tied to anything else. Instead, think of the game as being tied to it, to the rich world, characters and stories it describes.
