# About Bionic Blue lore

This website is meant to work as a story bible for the universe wherein the Bionic Blue game takes place. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_(screenwriting)):

> A bible, also known as a show bible or pitch bible, is a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a television, film or video game project.

However, I don't like the terms "story bible", "show bible" or "pitch bible".

"Story bible" is bad because stories usually have a beginning and an end, but I want the document to be a reference for the universe where the game happens, potentially being used for sequels/prequels, not just a single story. There could even be unrelated stories spun from this documentation of the game's universe, so the term "story" would be a limiting factor.

"Show bible" doesn't cut it either because it is obviously not for a show, but a game. However, I also don't want the content to be constrained by the fact that it is primarily for a game. Think of it as being more general than that, eventually being adapted for the game, but not constrained by it, as this could serve as source material for other works, related or not, like other game titles, books, etc.

"Pitch bible" would also be limiting, because although this kind of work is great for pitching projects (and I do intend to include such kind of content in it), this material is also not just for pitching.

That's why I use the term "lore" or "lore website", which is much more general and open-ended.
