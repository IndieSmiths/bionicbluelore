# About Bionic Blue lore

This website is meant to work as a story bible for the universe wherein the Bionic Blue game takes place. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_(screenwriting)):

> A bible, also known as a show bible or pitch bible, is a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a television, film or video game project.

However, I don't like the terms "story bible", "show bible" or "pitch bible". Each of them ties the contents to a specific medium or purpose (story, show, pitch). Sure, the bible is great for all of that, but I think it is a multipurpose document whose contents can provide the base for many different kinds of media. That is, I don't think it is just for stories, shows, video games, etc., and not only for the sake of pitching a project.

That's why I use the term "lore" or "lore website", which is much more general and open-ended.

Of course, since at first it is being used primarily to help me come up with the world building for the game, it will be heavily influenced by that kind of medium, but even so I want this lore to be independent, to stand on its own as a complete document not tied to anythign else. Instead, think of the game as being tied to it, to the rich world, characters and stories it describes.
